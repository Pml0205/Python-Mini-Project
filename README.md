- Check if expenses exceed the monthly budget
- Clean, interactive command-line interface

## 📋 Predefined Categories

Would you like me to help you:
- Add data persistence (e.g., save to a file)?
- Turn this into a GUI or web app?
- Package it for command-line use with `argparse`?

Let me know how you'd like to evolve it!
